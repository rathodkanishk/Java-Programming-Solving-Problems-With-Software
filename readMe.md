***The primary purpose of this repository is to maintain a record of my progress through the courses.***
* I will constantly update this repository as I progress through the courses.
* The assignments and programming exercises uploaded here are the ones found in the course pages.
  * I have made a copy of these exercises for easy reference.
  * I have explained in detail almost every line of code for absolute clarity.
* I only wish to document my progress here, and do not advocate unethical, or unscrupulous behaviour.

*This repository is the beginning of my programming journey!*
