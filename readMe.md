_**The primary purpose of this repository is to maintain a record of my progress through the courses.**_
- I will constantly update this repository as I progress through the courses.
- I only wish to document my progress here, and do not advocate unethical, or unscrupulous behaviour.

*This repository is the beginning of my programming journey!*
